# Mentions

scooterEditor comes with inbuilt support for mentions marking. Editor accepts a
list of mention-able values as `mentions` prop. The list could either be items
of shape
`{ "{name: 'Mention 1', key: 'mention1', imageUrl: 'optional_image_url.jpg'}" }`
. Here the key prop is optional. The available mention suggestions are shown in
editor when user types a `@` character within editor content. The avatar image
in the mention suggestion list is enabled by providing a truthy value to the
`showImageInMention` prop.
