# Charater Count

scooterEditor can be configured to show the character count as and word count.
This can be achieved by providing the `characterCountStrategy` prop with the
string value `count`.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Character count and word count">
    <ScooterCore characterCountStrategy="count" />
  </Story>
</Canvas>

### **Charater Limit**

scooterEditor can be configured to enforce a character limit. This can be done
by providing an integer value to the `characterLimit` prop. Additionally,
provide the `characterCountStrategy` prop with the string value `limit` to
display the number of characters remaining.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Character limit">
    <ScooterCore characterCountStrategy="limit" characterLimit={100} />
  </Story>
</Canvas>
