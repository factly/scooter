# Placeholder

The editor can have placeholder texts for different nodes. These value is
accepted as `placeholder` prop.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Placeholder">
    <ScooterCore placeholder="Input text here" />
  </Story>
</Canvas>

- **Value as object**: Each type of node can have corresponding placeholder, in
  which case the value should be of type `{"{node_name:placeholder_text}"}`.

- **Value as string**: When plain string is provided as value for placeholder,
  all the nodes will be using the same placeholder text irrespective of their
  type in which case the value should be of type.

- **Value as function**: the `placeholder` prop can also accepts a function. For
  each node in the document, the function receives node as argument and return
  the corresponding placeholder string. eg: `{"({node}) => placeholder_text"}`
