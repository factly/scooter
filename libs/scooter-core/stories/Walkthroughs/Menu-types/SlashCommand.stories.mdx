Financial assistance is provided to encourage people to take up new LPG connections which is released in the name of the adult woman of the beneficiary’s family. The scheme was launched on 1 May 2016 in Uttar Pradesh. Even the World Health Organization (WHO) <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://pib.nic.in/PressReleaseIframePage.aspx?PRID%3D1558097&amp;source=gmail-html&amp;ust=1659722224087000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1CufVLDYie5Mgl-k7FtT8h" rel="noopener noreferrer noreferrer" target="_blank">appreciated</a> the scheme for being a <em>‘decisive intervention to check the indoor health pollution being faced by the women of the country’. </em></p>     <p></p>     <p>However, sustaining the use of LPG by the beneficiary families in the absence of a major subsidy or a limited subsidy of Rs. 200 per cylinder, remains a challenge.

However, in this period, over 7.18 crore connections were released which is 1.18 crore connections more than the target. Later, the target was set to provide 8 crore connections by 2020 which was achieved by September 2019. In 2021, Phase-II of the scheme was launched to release 1 crore deposit free LPG connection on pan India basis, in addition to the 8 crore LPG connections already released under Phase-I of PMUY. Again, in 2022, the Government extended the Scheme to release additional 60 lakh LPG connections under PMUY 2.0 on existing modalities. </p>     <p></p>     <p><strong>30% of the LPG connections in India are under PMUY</strong></p>     <p></p>     <p>As on 04 July 2022, according to the PMUY <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.pmuy.gov.in/index.aspx&amp;source=gmail-html&amp;ust=1659722224087000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1i4WRuPSjPj1cb1eYaU5RY" rel="noopener noreferrer noreferrer" target="_blank">website</a>, a total of 9.34 crore connections have been released under PMUY since inception, including 1.35 crore connections released under PMUY 2.0.

The indicator to monitor this progress is tracking the number of refills under the scheme and the trend in average refills. This becomes critical in the light of steep hike in the LPG prices and the government’s subsidy limited to <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://pqars.nic.in/annex/257/AU1638.pdf&amp;source=gmail-html&amp;ust=1659722224087000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2autgpeM8mBO45l65j2b5Y" rel="noopener noreferrer noreferrer" target="_blank">Rs. 200 per cylinder</a> for PMUY beneficiaries.</p>     <p></p>     <p>The price of a 14.2kg Domestic LPG Cylinder (Retail Selling Price at Delhi) has increased from Rs. 650.5 as on <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://164.100.24.220/loksabhaquestions/annex/177/AU1990.pdf&amp;source=gmail-html&amp;ust=1659722224087000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0n6dNEIkklkKo6-LcQnW3Q" rel="noopener noreferrer noreferrer" target="_blank">01 May 2018</a> to Rs. 1053 as on <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://164.100.24.220/loksabhaquestions/annex/179/AU742.pdf&amp;source=gmail-html&amp;ust=1659722224087000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1WPLvwXNtdFkyn7VwhDmYo" rel="noopener noreferrer noreferrer" target="_blank">06 July 2022</a>.

The states have been categorized into three based on the number of connections. These are- states with more than 50 lakh connections, those with 10 to 50 lakh connections, and those with 1 lakh to 10 lakh connections. </p>     <p></p>     <p>Like the national trend, the average cylinder refills peaked in 2020-21 and dropped in 2021-22 in all the states except Delhi.</p>     <p></p>     <p>Among the states with more than 50 lakh connections under PMUY, all six states saw a decline in the average number of refills between 2016-17 and 2018-19. Except for Bihar and Odisha, the remaining states witnessed a marginal increase in refills in 2019-20. </p>     <p></p>     <p>Similar trends were observed in Assam, Chhattisgarh, and Gujarat, which had 10 to 50 lakh connections. Of the remaining states in the category, Punjab and Tamil Nadu saw an increase in average refills up to 2018-19 followed by a drop in 2019-20. The average refills in Karnataka were less than 2 in 2016-17 which jumped to 4 in the following year. </p>     <p></p>     <p>Of the states with less than 10 lakh connections, Haryana saw an overall decline in refills from 6.7 in 2016-17 to 5.34 in 2021-22. In Delhi, there was a drastic increase in refills from 6.6 in 2017-18 to 12 in 2018-19, which dropped to 7.9 in 2019-20. In 2021-22, the average refills in Delhi was 6.2. In both Delhi &amp; Haryana, the average refill number is significantly high than in other states. </p>     <p></p>         <p></p>     <p><strong>About 2 crore beneficiaries in 2021-22 took one or no refill</strong></p>     <p></p>     <p>According to a <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://pqars.nic.in/annex/257/AU1740.pdf&amp;source=gmail-html&amp;ust=1659722224087000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1V_rbomqBAzNAyXtAkKrKR" rel="noopener noreferrer noreferrer" target="_blank">response</a> in the Rajya Sabha to a question on the total number of beneficiaries of PMUY who took one or no refills in the last five years, 1.65 crore customers in 2017-18, 4.14 crore in 2018-19, 3.24 crore in 2019-20, 0.77 crore in 2020-21, and 2 crore customers in 2021-22 took one or no refill.  That is, they either did not take a refill at all or took only one refill (including the installation refill). A total of 2 crore PMUY customers out of the total 9.34 crore PMUY customers in 2021-22 accounts for 21.4% of the customers taking one or no refill.  The response also stated that during 2021- 22, out of the total domestic active customers of 30.53 crores, 2.11 crore domestic LPG customers had not taken any refill while 2.91 crores domestic LPG customers had taken only one refill. That is, a total of 5.02 crore customers took either no or one refill. </p>     <p></p>     <p></p>     <p></p>     <p></p>         <p></p>     <p><strong>CAG report, 2019 noted that annual refill consumption for PMUY beneficiaries was low compared to non-PMUY consumers</strong></p>     <p></p>     <p>The issue of sustained use of LPG cylinders under the scheme has been highlighted previously by multiple studies and reports. A CAG report from 2019 noted that the average <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://cag.gov.in/uploads/download_audit_report/2019/Report_No_14_of_2019_Performance_Audit_of_Pradhan_Mantri_Ujjwala_Yojana_Ministry_of_Petroleum_and_Natural_Gas_0.pdf%23page%3D63&amp;source=gmail-html&amp;ust=1659722224087000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2OV7oQl5i0NkpkwI-ucSeL" rel="noopener noreferrer noreferrer" target="_blank">annual refill consumption</a> for PMUY beneficiaries has remained low (roughly half) as compared to non-PMUY consumers. The report also noted that there was a delay in the installation of new connections under the scheme. Further, it found that 14 lakh beneficiaries consumed 3 to 41 cylinders in one month. Nearly two lakh beneficiaries had an annual consumption of more than 12 cylinders. These point toward the risk of domestic cylinders being diverted for commercial purposes. Unsafe practices by beneficiaries such as placing stoves near the cylinder on the ground were also observed by CAG. </p>     <p></p>     <p>Another survey conducted by the <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://riceinstitute.org/research/persistence-of-solid-fuel-use-despite-increases-in-lpg-ownership-new-survey-evidence-from-rural-north-india/&amp;source=gmail-html&amp;ust=1659722224087000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0gTR7as8h76go5DhvPE-f4" rel="noopener noreferrer noreferrer" target="_blank">Research Institute for Compassionate Economics</a> in 2018 found that despite having LPG connections, about 78% of the respondents in Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, and Madhya Pradesh used traditional wood <em>chulhas </em>(stoves) for cooking. These are also those states with a higher number of beneficiaries under PMUY. </p>     <p></p>     <p><strong>Ecowrap noted that increasing prices will result in people going back to using unclean fuels for cooking</strong></p>     <p></p>     <p>SBI’s research report, <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://sbi.co.in/documents/13958/2820818/1702201428-Ecowrap_20200217.pdf/4d805b7b-86ed-345c-8232-854791b64a0e?t%3D1581929334459%26TSPD_101_R0%3D08b90ded0cab2000e8a5cb804d29d09803b1bfb41d0e7b3aa930ba7ecaf2c1e8ad96005228a5d8d608f97602f514300070980d60447c1fcb32b0461dc8516bf0322bc450751feb20fe6eda083c466d65b4c72c23f3a114277de8524d20a825ee&amp;source=gmail-html&amp;ust=1659722224087000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2Dp0atJ3Vfipo9X_AV7EM-" rel="noopener noreferrer noreferrer" target="_blank">Ecowrap</a>, published in February 2020 stated that “<em>PMUY has solved the problem of availability, but the affordability barrier still exists.</em>” As per their analysis, 54.2% of total PMUY consumers consumed up to 3 cylinders in a year or more while a family of 4 requires at least 3-4 cylinders per year. It noted that PMUY use among the rural households in states with low per capita income may be lower due to continuous increases in LPG prices and that the beneficiaries go back to using unclean fuels for cooking. </p>     <p></p>     <p><strong>Gains made with PMUY stand threatened with an increase in prices</strong></p>     <p></p>     <p>The PMUY has resulted in a large number of rural households shifting to use cleaner LPG fuel for cooking. However, these gains stand threatened in the light of the steep increase in LPG prices and the limited government subsidy of Rs. 200 per cylinder. Data also indicates that after the free cylinder intervention under the PMGKP increased the average refills in 2020-21, the average decreased in 2021-22. </p>     <p></p>     <p><strong>Featured Image:</strong> <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.ceew.in/sites/all/themes/ceew/images/energy.jpg&amp;source=gmail-html&amp;ust=1659722224087000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2GN9AJodaDzeZjQEksYQaL" rel="noreferrer noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">PM Ujjwala  LPG Cylinder Refills</a></p>     <p></p>`} />
